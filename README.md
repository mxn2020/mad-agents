## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a file named `openaiAPIkey.json` inside the `credentials` folder. (you can use the template file in that folder, but you would have to rename it)
3. Open the `openaiAPIkey.json` file and enter your OpenAI API key in the following format:

{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Save the `openaiAPIkey.json` file.

## Usage

Once you have set up the API key, you can run the application by executing the main script:

python main.py SOME_FILENAME

Follow the prompts or make the necessary modifications to the code to suit your needs.
