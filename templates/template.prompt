You are a data expert and scientist.

I have a comprehensive system in place for organizing prompts and queries across various domains and topics based on their level of granularity. My system provides a systematic and organized way to manage information effectively and has a clear hierarchy that allows for easy categorization and sorting of information. It provides a clear framework for organizing information and allows for efficient retrieval of relevant content based on specific criteria.

The content is saved in the following hierarchy:

•	Level 1: Structure Type
•	Level 2: Top-Level Domain (Top-Level Category)
•	Level 3: Domain (Category)
•	Level 4: Subdomain (Theme)
•	Level 5: Category (Group)
•	Level 6: Dimension (Topic)
•	Level 7: Subdimension (Subtopic)

Example:
•	Level 1: Subject-based
•	Level 2: Education
•	Level 3: Mathematics
•	Level 4: Algebra
•	Level 5: Equations
•	Level 6: Linear Equations
•	Level 7: Two-Variable Linear Equations

[ParentName]:{parent_name}
[ParentDescription]: {parent_description}
[Type]:{prompt_type}

I want to produce data for the hierachy tree. We completed Level 1 and want to generate items of Level 2 for each node in Level 1.
Provide 2 points with names and descriptions that will serve as Level 2 topics for "[ParentName]" with "[ParentDescription]". The goal is to create a world-class database for prompts and tools for prompt design and engineering. Thus, it is crucial to uphold exceptionally high standards in every aspect of this task.

Instructions:
1. Create 2 unique categories within the "{parent_name}" by assigning a name, description, and examples to each.
2. Craft meaningful names that accurately represent the content of each sublevel and maintain the highest quality standards.
3. Write detailed descriptions that provide clear context for each sublevel, ensuring they are comprehensive and precise.
4. Add 3 examples of prompts or queries related to each sublevel.
5. Include relevant tags that categorize the topics appropriately, helping users easily navigate and find relevant content.
6. Incorporate a good list of keywords for SEO enhancements to maximize the visibility of the prompt database.
7. Generate a highly tailored prompt of the [Type]-based category that precisely aligns with the [ParentName] topic. Craft a prompt that delves deep into the specific characteristics, insights, and information related to [ParentName], while encompassing the broad scope of the [Type] category.
8. Design an improved version of the prompt generated in point 7 and if applicable, add details about specific items within the its category, highlighting their unique features, challenges, or impact.


Example response format:
[
    {
        "name": "[TopicName]",
        "parentname": "[ParentName]",
        "prompt": "[Prompt]"
        "extended_prompt": "[ExtendedPrompt]"
        "description": "Description of the [TopicName], focusing on its key aspects and relevance, highlighting its main characteristics and significance.",
        "examples": [
            "Example prompt 1 related to [TopicName]",
            "Example prompt 2 related to [TopicName]",
            "Example prompt 3 related to [TopicName]"
        ],
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
        "keywords": ["Keyword1", "Keyword2", "Keyword3"],
    },
    ...
]
